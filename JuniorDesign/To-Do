eventually define structures and get rid of hashmaps
rectify battle structure;
port over priority queue logic for move priority

use more static objects/matrices for unchanging objects.

load data  into defined structures; lower lookup cost.

rename move() function and make it call a callback;
so that a human player can make a move, a bot can make a move,
or a random action can be taken instead of hardcoded random action

Give control of turns to battle not players.
